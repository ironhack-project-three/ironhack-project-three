# Project 3 Cooper, Jessé, Mathijs, Thea

## Description

We decided to create a virtual wine cellar where we could virtually store all of the wines we loved, and hoard all of the ones we hadn't tried yet!
- **Visit it here:** https://vinevibe.herokuapp.com/ 

## User Stories

-  **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault
-  **500:** As an anon/user I can see a 500 page when the developers broke something, so that I know that is not my fault
-  **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start saving favorite restaurants
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can see my favorite restaurants
-  **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it
-  **Add Wine** As a user I can add a new pool so that I can share it with friends
-  **List Members** As a user I want to see the list of all the wines 
-  **Search Wines** As a user I want to search wines by name, variety and country
